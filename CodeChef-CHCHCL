'''Two players are breaking a chocolate bar of N x M size into pieces. A player’s turn
consists of choosing one piece and breaking it in two. A player who is unable to break
the chocolate further loses. Which player wins the game?
Explanation:
This is a very easy problem. We know that the chocolate can be broken into N x M
pieces at max. Once we have N x M chocolate pieces of size 1 x 1, the next player
loses. So, the outcome of the game depends on who makes the N*Mth move. If N*M is
odd, the first player to make the move loses; otherwise, if N*M is even, the second
player loses.So, the logic is – just check if a number is even or odd!'''
